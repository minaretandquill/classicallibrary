<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build a library website for Islamic classical works. The initial request was for book covers to be displayed as thumbnails, with filtering options by category, author, and subject.

Over the session, the user expanded the requirements to include:
-   **Comprehensive Filtering**: Added filters for Madhab, Language, Creed, Era, Type of Book, and Commentary Of.
-   **Nested Subjects**: Subjects should be filtered based on the selected Category.
-   **Sorting**: Default sort order should be by the scholar's birth year.
-   **Detailed Book View**: A modal showing extensive details, including a What Makes This Book Unique section, a list of related works (commentaries), and published editions.
-   **UI Adjustments**: A more compact grid (4 books per row).
-   **Content Management**: The user is non-technical and wants a way to manage the content. After discussing options, the user chose a static site deployment model to avoid hosting costs. The workflow involves the user providing content (in a specified JSON format), the agent updating the mock data file, rebuilding the app, and the user manually uploading the static files to their Plesk server.
-   **Branding & UI Fixes**: The user's latest request is to make the filter panel scrollable, replace Emergent branding with their own Minaret and Quill House logo and link, set a favicon, and other minor UI tweaks.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a frontend-only React application. All book data (~57 books) and filter options are hardcoded in . The application displays a grid of books that can be extensively filtered and sorted. Clicking a book opens a detailed modal view. A static build of the website is generated and placed in a user-accessible folder () for manual deployment to the user's Plesk hosting. Several markdown guides have been created to help the user with content editing and deployment.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent was just about to start working on a new set of UI/UX improvements and branding changes requested by the user.
-   Status: NOT STARTED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: UI/UX and Branding Updates (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The user has requested several changes to the UI and branding.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: None, this is a new request.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  **Filter Panel Scrolling**: Modify the CSS for the  component to allow its content to scroll independently of the main page. This likely involves setting a  and .
        2.  **Footer Branding**: In  or a layout component, remove the Made with Emergent tag. Add a new footer with the text Powered by Minaret and Quill House, linking to . Use the provided logo .
        3.  **Header Logo**: Add the Minaret and Quill House logo to the main header/banner area in .
        4.  **Favicon**: Update  and potentially add the green book icon asset to the  folder to set it as the site's favicon.
        5.  **Title Change**: In , remove the text - Hanafi Madhab Focus from the main title.
        6.  **Placeholder Note Logic**: The user asked how to remove the placeholder image note. Explain that this requires editing the  boolean to  for the specific book in  and modifying the rendering logic in  or . Implement this change so the note is conditional.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To improve user experience, apply the user's custom branding, and make the site look more professional and aligned with the user's vision.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Backend and Admin Panel (P2)**: The user has opted for a static site for now to save costs, but has been informed about the possibility of a full backend with a database (MongoDB) and an admin panel. This would allow them to manage books, images, and filter options through a web interface instead of editing the  file. This remains a potential future project if the manual update process becomes too cumbersome.

**Completed work in this session**
-   Frontend application scaffolding with mock data.
-   Implementation of a comprehensive filtering system (Category, Subject, Author, Madhab, etc.).
-   Implementation of nested subject filtering.
-   Implementation of default sorting by scholar's birth year.
-   Creation of a detailed book view modal.
-   UI grid layout adjusted to 4 columns.
-   System for linking commentaries and base texts (Related Works).
-   Addition of over 50 classical works with detailed information into .
-   Established a static build process (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.) for deployment on external hosting.
-   Created multiple user guides ( files) for deployment, content editing, and image replacement.
-   Resolved deployment issues by creating a visible  folder with the build output for the user.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The agent has addressed all issues raised by the user so far.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS for styling.
-   **Data Management**: All application data is stored in-memory, sourced from . There is no database or backend API in use.
-   **Deployment Strategy**: Static Site Generation. The React app is built into static HTML, CSS, and JS files using yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.. The user then manually uploads these files to their Plesk web hosting.

**key DB schema**
-   N/A. No database is in use.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None. The project has remained a React/FastAPI/Mongo stack, although only the React portion is being actively developed per the user's request for a static site.

**All files of reference**
-   : **Most important file**. Contains all book data, author lists, and filter categories. All content changes happen here.
-   : The main page component, manages state for filters, sorting, and search.
-   : Renders the filter controls.
-   : Renders the modal with detailed book information.
-   : Renders a single book in the grid.
-   : A non-git-tracked folder created to hold the latest build output for the user to easily find and download.
-   : A template for the user to format new book data using an external AI tool.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file is over 1500 lines long and contains data for 57+ books. This is becoming difficult to manage and is not scalable. The long-term solution is the proposed backend and admin panel.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is non-technical and has chosen a static-site workflow to avoid hosting costs. The core task is to update the React frontend (mostly ), run yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command., and place the output in  for the user to manually deploy.
-   Do not push the  or  folders to the GitHub repository. The user pushes source code; the build process happens within the agent's environment.
-   The user will provide new book data formatted in JSON (as per ). Be prepared to integrate this data into .
-   The user has their own branding (Minaret and Quill House) and wants it applied to the site.
